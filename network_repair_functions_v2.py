'''
This module contains an implementation of the  network repair methodology
introduced in Campbell and Albert (2014), BMC Syst. Biol.

The code should be straightforward to apply (see network_repair_tutorial.py).

I will be happy to respond to questions and/or comments.

Contact: colin.campbell@psu.edu
Python Version: 2.7.x
Date: April 2014

Modification List by Gang:
1. Line 121: Gang changes the code here in case that this is a source node, input_state gonna be '' 07/23/2014
2. Line 280: Gang has changed shift(a,asi) into shift(a[1],asi) 08/14/2014
3. Line 436: Gang inserted code here to take care of SS failure case 08/31/2014
4. Line 644: Gang inserted code here to deal with the failure case of SS repair 08/31/2014
5. Line 661: Gang added the following five lines(including this one) to check the order of the attractor 08/14/2014
Date 09/21/2014

6. This version allow asynchrounous updating when finding attractors. Thus, there's one more variable there to determine it.
   It can be 'sync' or 'async'  09/22/2014

7. Gang add another function called find_all_attractor_asyn to find all the SS of a network using a faster algorithm.
   Also I add another updating scheme under find_attractor to update the state just for one time-step.
