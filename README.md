# DamageMitigation

This is a temporary repo for the code used in paper "Compensatory interactions to stabilize multiple steady states or mitigate the effects of multiple deregulations in biological networks"

The code is based on the scripts from Booleannet: https://github.com/ialbert/booleannet/tree/master/scripts

Please use network_repair_functions_v2.py to replace the network_repair_functions.py and add the network_repair2_functions.py to the same folder.

network_repair2_functions.py contains functionality to repair two node damage.
